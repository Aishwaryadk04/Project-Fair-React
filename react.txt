                           Features & concept
                        ---------------------------
                        1. Used to built UI with the help of Javascript libraries
                        2. Used to bulid Single page application
                        3. Declarative : 
                        4. Immutable
                        5. Pure Functions :  It should not cause a side effects
                        6. Virtual DOM'ing
                        7. Unidirectional data flow : parent to child flow(bad feature)
                        8. JSX - (Javascript XML)  
                               - Every jsx expression should be placed inside a single tag
                               -React fragment : <> </>
                               -Instead of Attribute class use className
                               -Instead of Attribute for use htmlFor
                               -To display js expression in jsx, place js expression inside a {}
                               -Every tag should has its closing tag 
                               -self closing tag
                        9. Transpilling : converting jsx to HTML,CSS,JS         (in browser - HTML,CSS,JS)  
                         ----  babel (library Used -- js language)
                        10. To create React Application --- create-react-app command
                        11. React application consist of one or more components : A tree structure of components 
                        with a starting Component - App component
                        12. Component : is small part of UI , return HTML 
                                 -Is js file, with file name  and component name always starts with a letter
                                 -Different Component in React
                                      -Functional/Stateless components
                                      -Class/Statefull based components
                        13. Props : used to share data from parent to child 
                                    -it is a object
                                    -child component can access shared data via props from its arrgument 
                        14. Styling components Using CSS
                                   - Inline CSS
                                   - External CSS Sheet
                                   - CSS Module : a file with extension as .module.css 
                        15. React Event Handling
                                   - without argument : event bind using its function name only
                                   - with argument: eventbind using argument
                                   - with event object : event bind using arrow function with event object
                        16. Conditional Rendering :
                                   - if statements : && operator
                                   - if-else statements : ?: Ternary operator 
                        17. React State :
                                   - predefined object to store property of a class based component
                                   - when state changes then component re-Render
                                   - to change value of state -use setState(Value)
                        18. React Component Lifecycle
                                   - Mounting phase : putting all elements into DOM
                                        -constructor()
                                        -getDerivedStateFromProps()
                                        -render()
                                        -componentDidMount()
                                   - Updating phasse : While updating component
                                        - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                                        - shouldComponentUpdate()
                                        - render()  -if return is true (there is any change)
                                        - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                                        - componentDidUpdate()
                                   - Unmounting phase : Removing component from DOM
                                        - componentDidUnmount()
                        19. React Hooks : provide react Features like state and Lifecycleetc to Functional component
                                   - Import hook from react to Functional component by calling hook
                                   - Hook can only called at top level of component
                                   - Hook cannot be Conditional
                                   - Types Of  Hooks 
                                        - Predefined Hook 
                                          - useState(initial-value) : return state and function to updating state
                                          - useEffect(<function>,<dependency>) Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
                                                  - dependency is optional
                                                  - useEffect runs on every render
                                                  - Based on dependency we can control side effects
                                                      - No dependency is passing : Runs on every render
                                                      - If dependency passed is a empty array : Runs only on the first render
                                                      - props or state value changed : Runs on first render, And any time any dependency value changes.
                                                  - useNavigate() : used to redirect from one page to another, return a method for changing the location
                                        - Custom Hook 
                        20. Rendering List (Array of List) : use map method 
                        21. React Forms : handled by component
                                   - preventDefault() :methods cancels the event if it is cancelable
                                   - component inside form classified into diffenrent Types
                                       - Controlled components : are managed by react component (a firm expect this)
                                       - Uncontrolled components : are managed by DOM (Here data obtained dynamically)

                        22. API call - React
                                  - Use of Axios Library: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
                                  - Creating an instances : using create method in axios
                         
                         23. Routing /set up path for components in React
                                   - Use react-router-dom Library
                                        - entire app should be inside BrowserRouter
                                        - Wrap all components which needed to be set up path inside Routes
                                        - To set up path for components use Route
                                   - Link - used to redirect from one page to another
                                   - useNavigate Hook : redirection

                         24. REDUX : State Management System
                              -Advantages
                                   - Avoid props Drilling :
                                   - Reduce Coupling Components
                              -Work flow
                                   - Store : js file , Which can globally accessed by react app
                                        - used to store the state
                                        - To access store by react app use Provider selector from react-redux Library
                                        - To access state from store to component , use useSelector Hook from react-redux Library
                                   - Actions : js file , used to defie logic to update the state
                                        - To execute Actions , component should dispach the Actions
                                             - To dispach action in component , use useDispatch Hook from react-redux Library
                                   - Reducers :  js file , to update state in store
                                        - reducers gets response from Action as payload to update state in store
